For over 8 years, StillCraft Events Co. has been transforming events in Nairobi, Kenya with our unique Human Living Statues. We were the first to introduce this interactive art form to the local events industry, and our custom-designed performances continue to captivate audiences.

Our living statues aren’t just eye-catching—they actively engage guests and enhance the overall experience at corporate events, weddings, festivals, and more. By blending artistry with performance, we help create an atmosphere that’s both memorable and fun.

If you’re looking to make your event stand out in Nairobi, our Human Living Statues are the perfect way to add a touch of creativity and innovation.
